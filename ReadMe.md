## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.

Once completed the repository should contain your code,
a short report, and any instructions needed to run your
code.

## Overview
For this assignment you will write a serial version of a matrix multiply program. For part 2 you will implement a serial version. For this assignment the matrices can be square in order to simplify programming. A set of matrix utility functions is provided for matrix creation, reading from, and writing to a file.

## Requirements
Write a serial matrix multiply program in Python. The could should use reasonable decomposition, use reasonable variable names, and should generally follow good coding standards.

1. The program shall implement all necessary matrix operations, APIs shall not be used
2. The program shall print a small portion of the matrix so correct results can be verified
3. The program shall time how long it takes to complete the matrix multiply portion
4. The program shall include any necessary instructions to properly run the program
5. The assignment shall be submitted through github
6. The github repo shall not contain any datafiles, instructions shall be included on how to generate them if necessary

7. The program should use large enough matrix sizes so that execution time is reasonably long (~10s), this will vary based on your computer
